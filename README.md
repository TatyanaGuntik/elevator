# elevator


## How to run a script
- Create an instance of the class elevator.
- Create one or more instances of the class human. 
For each, specify 2 arguments - startFloor & finishFloor.
- Pass each humans to the method pushTheButton().
- Call function run().

Result: You will see on the screen the order on which floor the elevator will arrive.

##How it works

The first passenger who pushTheButton() sets the direction of transfer - up(true) or down(false).
Requests of passengers who want to transfer the same direction will be carry out at the first place.

###Feature

> Assume that all passengers enter on the same floor.
>
> This script works like elevator in an old house.
> If passengers transfer from the first floor to the eighth,
> you cannot enter on the third floor and go upstairs together. 
> At first elevator transfer to the eighth floor and after return to you.
